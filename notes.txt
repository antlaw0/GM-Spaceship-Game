This is an intense, Sci-Fi battle track. It comes right out rocking with some fast cello, rocking bass, gliding piano and some moving synth elements bouncing around in the back. About halfway through this one, our lead changes from the space-like synth to some french horns to help us through the fight.

Thanks so much to all those who choose to support me and my efforts to provide this music! Best wishes!

intro message text:

Our solar system is being invaded by a hostile alien force. Multiple incursions have been detected near the edge of the sol system. Automated defenses are online for earth, mars, jupiter, and saturn. Defend these key locations while mounting assaults on the alien motherships around the system. These motherships are harvesting resources from our system in order to manufacture new ships to expand their invasion force. Your mission is to destroy all alien ships. You are humanity's last hope. Good luck.
