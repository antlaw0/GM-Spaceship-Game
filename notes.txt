intro message text:

Our solar system is being invaded by a hostile alien force. Multiple incursions have been detected near the edge of the sol system. Automated defenses are online for earth, mars, jupiter, and saturn. Defend these key locations while mounting assaults on the alien motherships around the system. These motherships are harvesting resources from our system in order to manufacture new ships to expand their invasion force. Your mission is to destroy all alien ships. You are humanity's last hope. Good luck.
